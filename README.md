# GoServerBoilerplateAdvanced
My standard boilerplate for an advanced go webserver, with a lot of bells and whistles

## Features
-Postgres DB <br/>
-GORM as an ORM <br/>
-Wire Dependency Injection <br/>
-Mux for routing <br/>
-Simple Docker config <br/>
-Swagger for API Documentation <br/>
-Zerolog for logging, complete with logging middleware

## Getting Started
To get started, I make the assumption that you've got your whole go IDE set up and your GOPATH configured, etc. <br/>
<br/>
I named this sample project whimsy, after GiveCard's webserver of the same name, it's also my favorite word. <br/>
<br/>
Search the whole repo and replace whimsy in all occurences with whatever you've named your project (i.e. whatever package name you use when you run go mod init [package name])
